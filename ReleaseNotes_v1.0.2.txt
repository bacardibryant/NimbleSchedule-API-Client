Release Notes

In this release we continue our focus on exposing all of the read-only methods of the api first. Then as planned in the roadmap, we will begin to expose
the transactional api calls. Key changes in this release are noted below.

- Enclosed NimbleSchedule.Interface calls from the client within using statements so that its Dispose() method is called after the result is returned.

- Converted to C# 6.0 String format
	- MethodCall.WithDynamicStringParameter($"Some strings contain {variable} data and this syntax is more fluid");

- Implemented the following api calls and unit tests:
	- Locations/Index
	- Locations/GetAccessibleLocations
	- Countries/Index
	- Departments/Index

- Implemented test class constructor so that authInfo file i/o is only called once. Although in the case of test classes
  the constructor is called for each test method, so this would be the same as including the call in each method.
  However, try to stay consistent with good coding practices by following the DRY methodology, yet without abstracting away too much of the context
  so that you are still left with somewhat self-documenting code.
